Punk IPA App
Bootcamp Project

First eComm app, this version was developed after completing the Full MERN stack project as part of the bootcamp.  The MongoDB database has been replaced by local storage in the browser to demonstraite the frontend functionaltiy.  The API structure has been maintained so that the operation of the code is almost exactly the same, just not using a backend server.
